Back end development for an e-commerce website. 


## Description:
This setup enables the backend routes for an e-commerce website to add new products, categories and tags to their database. It uses expressJS and express routers so set up the API endpoints that modify the SQL database using sequilize. 

This is a exercise in using sequilize with SQL and node.js for object relational mapping.
